- **Fashion_MNIST_CNN.ipynb**  
  Implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** classifier for the **FashionMNIST dataset** (70,000 grayscale images of clothing items). Designed and trained a deep learning model to distinguish between 10 clothing categories at **28x28 pixel resolution**. Explored convolutional layers, pooling, and accuracy evaluation.
